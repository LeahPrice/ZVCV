# ZVCV
R package for Regularised Zero-Variance Control Variates

I am still working on the documentation for this package.

Details of the ZV-CV method can be found in:

Mira, A., Solgi, R., & Imparato, D. (2013). Zero variance Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian estimators. Statistics and Computing, 23(5), 653-662.

The regularised ZV-CV method is described in the following paper which will appear on arXiv within the next few days:

South, L. F., Mira, A., & Drovandi, C. (2018). Regularised zero variance control variates.
