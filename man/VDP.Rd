 \item{rho}{The tolerance for the new temperatures, which are selected so that the CESS at each temperature is \eqn{\rho*N} where \eqn{N} is the population size.}

\description{
This example illustrates how ZV-CV can be used for post-processing of results from likelihood-annealing SMC. In particular, we use ZV-CV to estimate posterior expectations and the evidence for a single SMC run of this example based on the Van der Pol oscillatory differential equations (Van der Pol, 1926). Further details about this example and applications to ZV-CV can be found in Oates et al. (2017) and South et al. (2019).

Given that the focus of this R package is on ZV-CV, we assume that samples have already been obtained from SMC and put into the correct format. One could use the R package \code{RcppSMC} or implement their own sampler in order to obtain results like this. The key is to make sure the derivatives of the log likelihood and log prior are stored, along with the inverse temperatures.
